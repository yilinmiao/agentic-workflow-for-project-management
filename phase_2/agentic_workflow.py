# Routing Agent
# TODO: 10 - Instantiate a routing_agent. You will need to define a list of agent dictionaries (routes) for Product Manager, Program Manager, and Development Engineer. Each dictionary should contain 'name', 'description', and 'func' (linking to a support function). Assign this list to the routing_agent's 'agents' attribute.

# Job function persona support functions
# TODO: 11 - Define the support functions for the routes of the routing agent (e.g., product_manager_support_function, program_manager_support_function, development_engineer_support_function).
# Each support function should:
#   1. Take the input query (e.g., a step from the action plan).
#   2. Get a response from the respective Knowledge Augmented Prompt Agent.
#   3. Have the response evaluated by the corresponding Evaluation Agent.
#   4. Return the final validated response.

#   3. Loop through the extracted workflow steps:
#      a. For each step, use the 'routing_agent' to route the step to the appropriate support function.
#      b. Append the result to 'completed_steps'.
#      c. Print information about the step being executed and its result.
#   4. After the loop, print the final output of the workflow (the last completed step).
